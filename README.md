# P-ginaVideojuegos
Hello!
This is my part of the final oject i did for a Java Bootcamp.
We wanted to create somthing for people who is interested in Anime, Manga and Videogames content. 
Also, for all of those creators, we wanted to offer an opportunity to be published and recognised for their work.

We had two weeks to get this done. 
There are a lot of things we want to change and things we want to do to make it what we wanted at first.
